# compress your files, using the power of David A Huffman

### TODO: make the code for the compression itself
###       make a shell script so that the C code can be run from the command line better
###       have a way to store the metadata, so that the decompression can be done
###       also make a homebrew tap so that it can be installed easily, for which a ruby file is needed
