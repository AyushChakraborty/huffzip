# huffzip

**huffzip** is a lightweight, command line file compression utility written in C, using the [Huffman coding algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding). It provides an efficient way to compress and decompress plain text files by using character frequency distributions.

This project is educational, minimal : perfect for understanding how entropy based compression works under the hood.
