# huffzip

**huffzip** is a lightweight file compression tool written in C, based on the Huffman coding algorithm. This is an ongoing project aimed at providing a simple and efficient way to compress files using Huffman encoding.

## Features

- Compress files using Huffman encoding
- Command-line interface for easy usage
- Planned Homebrew support for simple installation
- Modular design for maintainability and future extension

## TODO

- Implement the core compression logic
- Create a shell script to streamline CLI usage
- Store compression metadata to support decompression
- Write decompression functionality
- Create a Homebrew tap with a `.rb` formula for installation

## Installation

To be added once the Homebrew tap and shell script are complete.
